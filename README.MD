# Microsoft Endpoint Manager (Intune) App Factory tools

This was inspired heavily by @aaronparker in his scripts here: https://github.com/aaronparker/intune/tree/main/Apps

These are in progress scripts that will hopefully be improved over time to reduce manual labor needed to update and publish new versions of apps.

The Windows scripts rely heavily on Winget instead of Evergreen. The choice to use winget instead of Evergreen is because I'm already contributing to winget package manifests.
